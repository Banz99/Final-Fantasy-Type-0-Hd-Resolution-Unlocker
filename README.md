# Resolution unlocker for Final Fantasy Type 0 HD

This tool allows you inject your own resolution into the game, freeing it from the hardcoded list of resolutions that it normally ships with.
It works by replacing the standard 1080p with your own custom width and height specified in the .ini file (the release is already configured for 2560x1440). 

**Make sure you have selected 1920x1080 as resolution in the game's own launcher or this won't do anything.**

The code is largely based on the various SilentPatches released by CookiePLMonster.

_Warning_: Setting a resolution unsupported by your primary monitor will close the game immediately on startup.
